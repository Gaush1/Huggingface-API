In this project, I have integrated Huggingface Stable diffusion APIs and used Laravel's inbuilt authentication using Jetstream, and created views using Laravel Livewire. 

I have used two of the popular APIs in stable diffusion.

1. Epic-diffusion -> Epîc Diffusion is a general purpose model based on Stable Diffusion 1.x intended to replace the official SD releases as your default model. It is focused on providing high-quality output in a wide range of different styles, with support for NFSW content.
Epîc Diffusion 1.0 is a heavily calibrated merge of SD 1.4, SD 1.5, Analog Diffusion, Wavy Diffusion, Openjourney Diffusion, Samdoesarts Ultramerge, postapocalypse, Elldreth's Dream, Inkpunk Diffusion, Arcane Diffusion & Van Gogh Diffusion blended and reblended multiple times until I got the quality & consistency I was looking for...

2. Analog-Diffusion -> WavyMulder/Analog-Diffusion 
This is a dreambooth model trained on a diverse set of analog photographs.
